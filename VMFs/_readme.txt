ASSORTED DECOMPILED AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MAP FILES VERSION 1

A few notes:
This pack includes:
	-Decompiled versions of all Valve maps shipped in TF2
	-Decompiled versions of all Valve-bought maps shipped in TF2
	-Select SDK versions of Valve maps as shipped in the Source SDK
	-Valvebase, the unfinished Valve map supplied for the TF2Maps contest that gave use Mountainlab and Mann Manor
	-Select VMFs of community-owned maps shipped in TF2 whose creators volunteered to contribute to this pack
	
The decompile process is inherently flawed since some information is lost when a map is compiled. You are unlikely to be able to immediately compile these maps and expect them to work perfectly. Things like areaportals and certain entities will likely be missing or set up wrong.
These VMFs are published for TF2 Mapping reference purposes. All rights reserved by the respective owners. Collection assembled, decompiled by Brokk.
