Objective:
To win a point, steal the enemy's intelligence briefcase and return it to your base.

Other Notes:
Players drop the intelligence when they die. Dropped intelligence returns to its Base after 15 seconds.

Powerups can be picked up to give you various enhancements. You can only carry one powerup at a time, and you drop your powerup when you die. You have access to a grapple hook that you can use to fly around the map.
