### TF-BAMF Installer

This installer is based on NSIS 3.09

The scripts in this directory will build to an executable installer/uninstaller for the entire project.  
The initial script was created using NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator 1.09.18


TODOs:
* Insert more placeholder variables into script
* Figure out usage of wildcards
* Add autogenerated folders to delete list for uninstaller
* TEST!
* add custom installation options in UI
* Investigate automatic VPK cooking from BAMF Asset Packs
* Experiment with removing metadata fields from Install script (corporation, versionnumber, etc)
* Make stuff look good
* Separate Installer version from TF BAMF version

Build-Requirements:
* NSIS 3.09
* /at least/ NUI Plugin for NSIS
