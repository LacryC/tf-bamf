<div class="error_box"><h4>Error trying to allocate [sub:1] bytes</h4><p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Vrad.exe did not have enough memory to finish it's task. There are two causes: 1) You are running low on memory (ram + pagefile). 2) Vrad.exe is chocking on some very complicated bit of your map, causing it to ask a lot of memory which doesn't exist (like infinite sizes).<br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />If you are running low on free memory (ctr+alt+del to see that) try increasing the pagefile if you aren't letting Windows take care of it. If not, use cordon tools to isolate the problemarea in your map (might be a broken brush, or simply too complex geometry) and see what you can do to fix it.<br /><u>Dan Prati</u> informed me that is mostly a problem with very large, open maps, or particularly detailed ones (or as part of an engine limitation to the total amount of lightmaps).<br /><br />Reducing the lightmap resolution on larger surfaces, or particularly complex objects, can fix this problem. If this is not acceptable, or does not fix the error, reducing lightmap resolution across the entire map may be necessary. This provides a solution when there is no single map element that is causing the error, and simply deleting map objects won't fix the problem.<br /><br /><strong>See also:</strong><br /><a href="javascript:showerror(148)">Reference: Finding the unfindable</a></p><p><br /><span class="e_type e_lvl4">This error will cause your map to fail compiling correctly</span></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href="forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=0">Anonymous</a></h5></div>

Allthough easier said than done, you must try to find the overlay in Hammer (where you can only guess where your faces are cut) so its best to check big (stretched) overlays first, and also make sure you have no world brushes cutting each other up near these overlays (eg. near stairs, or when you use a small lightmap scale). The use of func_detail will stop that.<br />If you have an overlay that is applied to a very large brush, try cutting up the offending brush so it is not as large.

<div class="error_box"><h4>Found a displacement edge abutting multiple other edges</h4><p><strong>Description:</strong><br />A displacement is touching more than one other displacements at the same point along one of its edges; in other words: at some point, three displacements are touching each other along an entire edge.

I guess it can also be a wanted situation, in which cause this 'error' can be ignored.<br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />The usual cause i can think of is the accidental non-deletion of displacements along the sides of brushes. Eg, if you have two brushes next to each other, and their tops displaced, and you accidentally also displaced the vertical brushsides between these two, you get a T-shaped intersection of three.<br /><img src="images/errorpage/displ.png" class="errorpageImage" alt="image" /><br />image: purple: side that should've been destroyed, red: the edge.<br /><br />This is no real error, but it could be the cause of lighting anomalies.

3|make_triangles\:calc_triangle_representation\:\s+Cannot\s+convert
<div class="error_box"><h4>make_triangles:calc_triangle_representation: Cannot convert</h4><p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Usually preceded by some coordinates, the best explanation I can give at the moment is that this is caused by certain models (a b0rked subpart). In particular the &quot;/wasteland/InteriorFence002d.mdl&quot;-model. I've also heard small panes of glass and some other (even self-made) models can cause this error to occur, as do some freaky regular brushes. This error can also be caused by bad displacements.<br />If it is displacements they may fail to collide with vehicles and physics objects on the triangles that are causing a problem.  Parts of the displacement may still work others may not.   <br /><br /><strong>Solution:</strong><br />You can look for ages to find the model causing the problem, after hiding all your models first and see if that is causing your problem. Once found, you can decide to reconstruct that model, there doesn't seem to be a real error in the model itself though. In other words, leave it be, it won't hurt you. Unless you bite first! It may be the case that the game will not load the map because of this error. It would present you with a pup-up with the beloved memory error.<br />The displacement problem as of right now has only 1 solution and it is to delete the displacement. If its a brush, find it with Cordon Tools and delete it. </p><p><br /><span class="e_type e_lvl3">The affected object may not work and/or cause general errors</span></p><h5>Last contribution: <a href="forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4214">jmplayer</a></h5></div>
